NN_2018_by_Stop_by_Route.csv provides average weekday boardings by route by stop for service provided from 1/1/2018 through 12/31/2018.

NN_2019_2020_pre_covid.csv provides average weekday boardings by route by stop for service provided from 9/1/2019 through 3/14/2020.

NN_2020_post_covid.csv provides average weekday boardings by route by stop for service provided from 3/15/2020 through 9/30/2020.

If the stop-level boardings are aggregated by route and totaled, they will not match IndyGo's NTD reported data, because this dataset was not extracted from the same sources from which NTD data are reported.

To achieve stop-level boardings without splitting by route, the boardings for each stop may be totaled, then divided by the value in the Days column.
